Stu's Powerful I/O Tester (spit)

      ./spit/spit   - powerful test program, sequential random, queue depth, timings and more.

## Dependencies

      apt install libaio-dev

## Install

      cmake .
      make -j

## Man page

      man -l spit/man.1

## Simple tests
      spit -f device -c wk64    # test seq writes 64KiB

      spit -f device -c rs0     # test rand reads 4KiB

      spit -f device -c wk64j3 -c rk64j2    # three writers, two reader threads


## SNIA Common tests
      spit -f device -p G -c wk64    # precondition random 4k writes, test seq writes 64KiB

      spit -f device -p G -c rs0     # precondition random 4k writes, test rand reads 4KiB

      spit -f device -p G -c mP100000 # precondition, then R/W mix on 100,000 positions

## Usage

      cd spit
      ./spit

      Usage:
      
      spit -f device -c ... -c ... -c ... # defaults to 10 seconds
      spit -f device -c r           # seq read (s1)
      spit -f device -c w           # seq write (s1)
      spit -f device -c rs0         # random, (s)equential is 0
