.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBspit\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... \fIFILE\fP...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The spit(1) performs various I/O. The \fB\-c\fP command spins up a command
string on a dedicated thread.

.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.sp
\fBf device\fP
.RS 4
Specific a single device (e.g. \-f /dev/ram0)
.RE
.sp
\fBI filename\fP
.RS 4
Specific a file that contains a list of device names (e.g. \-f devices.txt)
.RE
.sp
\fBG size\fP
.RS 4
Limit the positions to a maximum of \fBsize\fP GiB (e.g. \-G 32)
.RE
.sp
\fBt s\fP

.RE
.sp
\fBp precondition_options\fP
.RS 4
Before executing any commands, run the precondition write
commands. Defaults to 4k writes. Options include: \fB\-p Gn\fP, \fB\-p Gs1\fP for
sequential, \fB\-p Gk8\fP for 8 KiB writes. (e.g. \-p G32)
.RE
.sp
\fBjN\fP
.RS 4
Multiply the number of commands (\fB\-c\fP) by N. (e.g. \-j 8)
.RE
.SS "Parallel commands"
.sp
A command is a single contiguous string. Spaces are ignored if the
entire string is quoted. An example of a command string may look like:
\fBspit\fP \-c \fBrk64P1000s3\fP \-f /dev/device
.sp
The command options are described below:
.sp
\fBr\fP
.RS 4
Performs reads

.sp
\fBw\fP
.RS 4
Performs writes
.RE
.sp
\fBGlow\-high\fP
